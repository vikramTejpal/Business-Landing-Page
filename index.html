                At Style Emporium, what is fashion to us?
                Fashion is a means of self-expression that allows people to try on many roles in life. Whether you
                prefer hip-hop or Chanel-chic, fashion accommodates the chameleon in all of us. It’s a way of
                celebrating the diversity and variety of the world in which we live. Fashion is about change which is
                necessary to keep life interesting. It’s also a mirror of sorts on society. It’s a way of measuring a
                mood that can be useful in many aspects, culturally, socially even psychologically. At the same time,
                fashion shouldn’t be taken too seriously or you lose the fun of it.
